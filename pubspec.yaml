  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/controller/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/images/gui/
    - assets/images/inventory/
    - assets/images/launcher/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: MinecraftFont
      fonts:
        - asset: assets\fonts\minecraft_font.ttf
